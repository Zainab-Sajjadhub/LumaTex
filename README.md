# LumaText
LumaText is an AI-powered web application designed to make reading, writing, and understanding text easier, especially for individuals with disabilities like dyslexia. We believe everyone deserves access to clear and understandable information, and LumaText was built with that mission in mind.

With LumaText, users can easily upload PDFs or text files and instantly extract the text inside. Our advanced AI then summarizes long and overwhelming documents into simple, easy-to-digest versions, helping users focus on the most important ideas without getting lost in complicated wording. For users who prefer listening over reading, LumaText also offers full text-to-speech functionality, reading both the uploaded content and summaries aloud at the click of a button.

Accessibility and customization are at the heart of LumaText. Users can adjust font size and font style to suit their needs, and a built-in dark mode provides a comfortable viewing experience for different lighting and sensory preferences. For those who find it easier to speak than type, LumaText offers a microphone note-taking feature, turning speech into written notes automatically.

LumaText combines powerful AI with thoughtful design to create a reading experience that is flexible, supportive, and truly inclusive. It's not just a tool — it’s a step toward making education and information accessible for everyone, regardless of their challenges.
